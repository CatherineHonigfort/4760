Please run my program from the command line [due to the fact that I have passed argv[0] to printf() in a way that demands the command line]

Please test the -h, -l, and -n flags, beyond these flags, no other flags were developed, and very little error handling is implmented. 

Known issues: missing requirements; not on the hoare server, and has missing code requirements.
